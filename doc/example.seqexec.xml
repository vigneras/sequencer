   An example of an Instructions Sequence Executor (ISE) input file.

   This example does not produce any side effect.
   Actions are just sleeping for some random time between 1 and 5 seconds
      
   This example shows how implicit dependencies (seq tag), parallelism (par tag) 
   and explicit dependencies (deps attribute)

   Execute this file with the following command:

   clmsequencer seqexec -f <this_file>

   See clmsequencer documentation for details.

       The instruction 'par' defines a set of inner intructions that
       *can* be executed in parallel. Note that this is not
       mandatory. A sequential execution is also a valid
       execution. There is no dependencies between instructions in the
       same 'par' instruction.

  <par>
    <!-- The instruction 'action' defines a command that should be
         executed. Eeach action *must* have a unique id. The ISE
         parser will ensure this constraint is respected. 
         
         This action generate a random number between 1 and 5 and
         sleep for that amount of seconds.
    -->
    <action id="1">
      n=$((1+$RANDOM%5))  bash -c 'echo "Sleeping for $n";sleep $n'
    </action>
    <!-- The instruction 'seq' defines a set of inner instructions
         that *must* be executed in sequence. Dependencies are
         implicit in that the order specified is respected. First
         instruction will get executed first, then second, and so on.
         
         This instruction specifies that action '2' must be executed
         before action '5'.

    <seq>

      <!-- Each 'desc' attribute will be used for logging when the
           'verbose' option is passed to 'clmsequencer'.  When unset,
           desc will be automatically set to "Description unset" in
           the model. 
           
           Other action attributes are: 
           
           - component_set: the set of components (hardware or
           software) this action has an effect on. Examples:
           node[10-20]#compute. When unset, it defaults to
           'localhost#unknown'.

           - remote: a boolean telling if the specified command should
           be executed locally or remotely (on each host specified by
           the component_set attribute). When unset, it defaults to
           'false'.

           - deps: an explicit list of dependencies. Before being
           executed, the ISE will ensure that all actions this action
           depends on completed succesfully. The list of actions this
           action depends on is made from implicit dependencies
           (expressed through the 'seq' tag) and explicit dependencies
           (expressed through the 'deps' attribute). Each id given in
           the 'deps' attribute *must* be a valid id referencing an
           action defined in this document. The ISE parser will ensure
           this constraint is respected.

         option 'force' is used. In the case of error, any action that
         depends on a failed executed action will *not* get executed.
         
         In this example, action '5' will not be executed unless you

    <!-- Complex example. Have a look to the dependency graph to get
         the picture of what should be going on depending on 'force'

         Generating the graph can be done using the 'graphto' option
         of 'clmsequencer seqexec'. Displaying that generated graph
         can be done using the Graphviz 'dotty' command.
