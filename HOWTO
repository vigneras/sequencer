*** Launching the unit test suite ***

'make test' should *not* work!!

You should configure your environment so dependent libraries are
installed. Those libraries are defined in the setup.py.

Here is the list (as of version 2.3, this README may not be up to date!):

Standard Lib:
python-graph >= 1.7.0,
pydot >= 1.0.2,
python-lxml >= 2.2.3,
graphviz >= 2.26,
clustershell >= 1.2.83


Standard Lib are easy to install and set-up:

	1. Either use easy_install or pip to install them ;

	2. or use your package manager ;

	3. or download source files and follow the instructions
	in each of them.

- Well almost, some specific tests might fail to run mainly due to
  configuration issue. This is especially true for tests that used ssh
  to some hosts (localhost). You should be able to do a password-less
  ssh to localhost. Some tests use test1 test2 and test3 as host
  names. Set up your ~/.ssh/config accordingly for example with the
  following entries:

Host localhost
        Hostname localhost
        VisualHostKey no

Host test1
        Hostname localhost
        VisualHostKey no

Host test2
        Hostname localhost
        VisualHostKey no

Host test3
        Hostname localhost
        VisualHostKey no



  Also, after an ssh to localhost, the command specified for remote
  execution should be found. If you are in a chrooted environment this
  might not work.


For details, you might use:

     nosetest -s

to see what is the output of each test.

Hope it helps!
