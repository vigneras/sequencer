# This script does the following:

# - Fetch the current version (should be a snapshot version) from the
# given file in the project directory

# - Remove the .snapshot part of the version to get the real version
# - Commit the new version
# - Tag the new version
# - Increase the second digit of the version number, and add the .snapshot suffix.
# - Commit
